# 2. Deeds NFT - Work Metaverse Organizations

## 2.1. NFT – Deeds defined
A non fungible token (NFT) is a unique token that represents a good. In the WoM, a Deed is used as a title of ownership. Each Deed gives its owner a right to access several services - for instance, an access to a digital office, powered by the Meeds software and the right to mint Meeds.

The WoM welcomes all kinds of organizations - DAOs, traditional corporations, associations, think tanks, partnerships, theatre companies, project groups, schools etc. The Deed represents their digital existence in the WoM.

## 2.2. Deeds supply
The WoM will ultimately supply a limited amount of Deeds. Each Deed includes a predefined maximum number of users and offers a capacity of Meeds rewarding (Minting Power). The term ‘user’ here and hereafter designates any type of employee, worker, freelancer, volunteer etc.

There are four types of Deeds, each providing different capabilities in terms of number of users, voting rights in a city (see 2.7) or Meeds minting power, the rarest being the most powerful :


| **Deed Type** | **Max users** | **Minting power** | **Scarcity** | **حقوق التصويت للمدينة** |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----------------- | ------------ | ------------------------ |
| Common        | 100           | 1                 | ~ 90%        | 1                        |
| Uncommon      | 1000          | 1.1               | ~ 9%         | 10                       |
| نادر          | 10 000        | 1.3               | ~ 1%         | 100                      |
| اسطوري        | غير محدود     | 2                 | < 0.1 %      | 1000                     |

## 2.3. Deeds ownership

A Deed gives its owner the right to USE it, RENT it, or SELL it.
- USE – The Deed’s owners can use the Deed directly for their organization, providing services to its users.
- RENT - The Deed’s owners can also rent the Deed to another organization in order to get passive income.
- SELL - A Deed can be sold on a secondary market such as [OpenSea](https://opensea.io).

Being an active holder or renter of a Deed, the organization is rewarded with Meeds, through an innovative “mintium” model described below (part 2.6).

## 2.4. Deeds services, engagement/rewards engine

In an increasingly competitive market, in order to attract and retain talents and maximize their input, organizations need to incentivize their users beyond simple compensation. The WoM provides an innovative framework to do that by tokenizing work engagement.

Each Deed’s holder or renter can provide tools and services to its users, who earn engagement points that can be fine-tuned to the Deed’s priorities. Periodically, points are converted into Meeds (and - for DAOs - potentially another token), based on the Deed’s set budget. In that manner, users’ engagement in activities that matter to the organization is rewarded.

To begin with, the following free services provided by the Meeds association can be used to reward engagement:
- Gamification engine – automatic actions within the WoM have a weight in points, that can be fine-tuned to the Deed’s priorities via customizable engagement programs.
- Challenges – customizable challenges can be set up to represent achievements. Challenges are preset by one person and can be full-filled and announced as such by another. Challenges carry a weight in points, within customizable engagement programs.
- Customizable engagement programs - organizations can create their own engagement programs matching their business goals and priorities. Programs are associated to automatic actions within the system and manually set challenges. Each program has a set Meeds budget. Periodically points earned by each user through automatics or announced actions in each engagement program are converted into Meeds, based on that program’s budget.
- الكودوس- يمكن منح الكودوس من قبل المستخدمين لبعضهم البعض، كشكر و رمز للاعتراف. As kudos available to distribute are limited (a preset periodic limit, 3 per week for instance), they are rare and valuable. Like actions, kudos carry points. وبهذه الطريقة يمكن للموظفين أن يكافئوا زملائهم.
- Collaboration tools, plugged into the rewarding engine – workspaces, asynchronous communication, a task management tool and notes – enable people to work together on projects.
- Wallet – users are provided with a secure Ethereum technology wallet to store their Meeds. Alternatively, for advanced users, a Metamask wallet can be used.
- Store – a store where Meeds can be exchanged against perks provided by the Deed’s holder or renter or by the Meeds ecosystem.
- Analytics – to analyze and follow engagement within the Deed.
- Connectors, plugged into the reward engine – users get engagement points via actions in another software - for instance for committing code in GitHub.

Some of the afore-mentioned tools and services are already decentralized, others are not. The ultimate goal is to provide all services in a decentralized manner, which we will do gradually as the underlying technology evolves.

New services can be plugged into the reward engine through APIs. Examples are countless and can include virtually any software or service:
- CRM software – salespeople would get engagement points for working on opportunities.
- Accounting software – accountants would get engagement points for keeping books.
- Clocking terminal – factory worker can get points for factory work time.
- Etc.

Furthermore, engagement produced via the connector participates in the organization’s global engagement score which is a factor of the Meeds minting distribution, described below. In order to do that, the connector needs to be whitelisted by the Meeds Association. The association reviews the connector, approves of its algorithm and acquires its ownership against Meeds. It then becomes part of the free services provided by the association and is included in the global engagement index. Any other Deed can use the same connector and the same reward algorithm for its developers.

The Deed’s holder or renter can enrich its store with its own perks, connect to an online perks offer etc. There again the possibilities are endless:
- دروس تدريبية
- Gym memberships
- Vacation packages
- Lunch with a leader in the organization
- Physical office space
- Etc

The store functions through the use of Meeds so that Meeds are partially returned to the Deed.

## 2.5. Rewards – Meeds and other tokens

The WoM will tokenize users engagement, by gamifying digital work tools, and attributing points and Meeds in relation to work engagement. Services plugged into the engagement and reward engine attribute points to each user, according to their engagement level and in line with each Deed’s engagement programs. Indeed, each Deed can fine-tune the amount of points given for each type of activity. Thus, pushing some code in GitHub may be worth 10 points for an IT shop, while a digital agency may attribute only 5 points for GitHub pushes but would offer 10 points for retweets.

Periodically, the rewarding engine converts engagement points into Meeds according to budgets and other distribution rules and ultimately rewards the users via their wallets. The Deed is not required to distribute Meeds and can use the engagement system to enable some other form of compensation program. However, distributing Meeds will improve its minting capacity.

Moreover, the Deed does not necessarily need to acquire Meeds in order to distribute them and fuel its engagement programs, as it will get Meeds from the “mintium” model, described below.

In addition to Meeds, it will also be possible to distribute other tokens (for instance the DAO’s own tokens) based on the same engagement mechanism. In that case, the distribution will be subject to a 5% transaction fee (in DAO token) for the Meeds Association.

## 2.6. The “mintium” model – tokenize work engagement

By engaging their users in the WoM, Deeds get compensated through an innovative mintium model.

Engagement points, gained by the Deeds’ users, participate in the global engagement index, calculated by the Meeds Association. The index uses the same principle for all Deeds. Even though the Deed can change the points’ allocation to promote one action over another, those changes will not be taken into the account in the global index computation.

Each week, a certain amount of Meeds is allocated to the global engagement minting of the WoM. It’s computed weekly, pro-rata, among the participating Deeds. Some Deeds get an additional boost depending on their type. The Deeds that claim their Meeds over the week, receive them. The unclaimed Meeds are added to the following week’s global distribution amount.

The engagement index is a function of the engagement, the number of engaged users and the distribution.

* **Engagement** – total number of actions accumulated by users within the Deed over the week. (At each Deed’s level, each action is converted into engagement points, some actions weighting more than others. At the index level, all actions are linearized).
* **Engaged users** – users that contributed to points during the week, by at least one action.
* **Average Engagement Rate** = Engagement/Engaged Users.
* **Distribution rate** – if a Deed received minted Meeds for the preceding period, the % of the Meeds that was distributed to its users. The % can be above 100 if the distribution is delayed in time.
* **Distribution spread** – if a Deed received minted Meeds for the preceding period, the % of the users that received Meeds in the total pool of users.

**Deed’s Engagement Score = Engagement * (Average Engagement Rate Deed / Average Engagement Rate WoM) * Distribution rate * Distribution spread * Minting power**

The global engagement index used to distribute minted Meeds among the Deeds is the sum of all Deeds’ engagement scores for the week.

The formula above is simple and designed to favor Deeds with :
- numerous engaged users (engagement)
- who share the whole of the minting income (distribution rate) with their users fairly (distribution spread).

Boosters are in place :
- For organizations with the highest engagement, regardless of their size (engagement rate in relation to the WoM)
- For rarer Deeds

The association reserves the right to change the formula if required – if some specific use cases arise for instance. The association can also blacklist any Deed that hijacks the formula to its unique benefit.

As the Deeds are rewarded with Meeds and incentivized to redistribute them as rewards to their users against their engagement – the interest of both the Deeds and their users are aligned in the same virtuous revenue sharing cycle. Thus, the WoM offers a new work model, that re-shapes the employer/employee relationship as a partnership.

The “mintium” model is the first of a kind - it goes further than the traditional freemium one, as not only the services are free to use but both the organizations and their users are rewarded for using them.

## 2.7. Cities and governance

In the WoM, Deeds will be generated gradually inside virtual cities. Only the first city will exist from the start. The others will be built gradually, one after the other. In the entire WoM, there will ever only be 7 cities, each including a fixed number of Deeds of each type.

A city will be considered complete, once all of its Deeds have been minted. Then, the minting of each new city will start 2<sup>n</sup> months after the last Deed of the n-1 city was minted.
| **City name**     | **Deeds**   | **Available**        | **Common** | **Uncommon** | **Rare**  | **Legendary** |
| ----------------- | ----------- | -------------------- | ---------- | ------------ | --------- | ------------- |
| المدينة 1: تانيت  | 100         | T0                   | 50         | 30           | 13        | 7             |
| المدينة 2: ريشيف  | 1 000       | Tanit + 4 months     | 600        | 300          | 94        | 6             |
| City 3: Ashtarte  | 10 000      | Reshef + 8 months    | 6 000      | 3 000        | 995       | 5             |
| المدينة 4: ملكارت | 100 000     | Ashtarte + 16 months | 60 000     | 30 000       | 9 996     | 4             |
| المدينة 5: اشمون  | 1 000 000   | Melqart + 32 months  | 600 000    | 300 000      | 99 997    | 3             |
| المدينة 6: كوشور  | 10 000 000  | Eshmum + 64 months   | 6 000 000  | 3 000 000    | 999 998   | 2             |
| المدينة 7: هامون  | 100 000 000 | Kushor + 128 months  | 60 000 000 | 30 000 000   | 9 999 999 | 1             |

A city is a way for the Deeds to come together and create a community. And as a consequence, acquire a certain identity, associated with that community. It is also a way to provide additional value to its users - value that would go beyond one Deed’s capabilities or value created through cooperation between the Deeds.

Each city has its own govenance and operates its own DAO where the city’s Deeds’ owners can elect their city council, vote and establish their own operating rules, add new services and shape their city in the way that they want and so as to increase the city’s attractiveness and the value of the Deeds attached to it.

For example, they could add a digital representation of their city, physical counterparts associated with their city (meeting rooms in physical co-working spaces for instance), add Meeds powered food services, vacations services, etc...

By default (unless the city votes otherwise), passive income from renting out Deeds will be “taxed” by the city (5%) and the Association (3%) to encourage productive use.

Ownsership transactions (Deed’s sales) will also be taxed 6% - 2.5% for the City, 2.5% for the Association and 1% for the original wallet that redeemed the Deed.
