# 5. WoM for All – Vision Summary and Roadmap

## 5.1. Ultimate Goal - Decentralized web for everyone

Ultimately, the WoM is a decentralized web world for everyone – every person and all organizations.

It will be populated by users, acting through their digital identities **Xeeds** and accessing the world through their Metamask for crypto-savvies or login/password for the newbies.
People would allocate their time and be rewarded fairly and transparently for their work. They would get access to the decentralized world and the crypto world of tomorrow quickly and familiarly - they would get simple tools to use their tokens in their lives or invest in them for their future.

Organizations will more efficiently source talents, browsing through the WoM for the right proven skills. The "Mintium" tokens will reward them for creating the conditions of genuine engagement and participation. But above all, they would benefit from higher engagement and loyalty from their contributors.

The WoM has its currency,  the **MEED** –  to spend in stores, swap with other currencies, invest, rent or buy, etc. The WoM also facilitates distributing other tokens and participating in the global crypto ecosystem.

As a picture is worth a thousand words, here is a diagram that describes the WoM and MEED token flows

The WoM will raise taxes on the generated value to ensure long-term availability and sustainability.

## 5.2. What's in it for early adopters

Early adopters get considerable advantages over the latecomers.

In particular, the WoM rewards long-term investment in the verse – the redeeming of Deeds. A Deed's original owner gets compensated through engagement minting (active use) through passive income (renting) and perceives a perpetual 1% on any selling transaction of the Deed (at each change of ownership, the original redeemer receives a fee on the transaction).

Early investors have participated in the liquidity pools to support the Meeds project. They also staked their MEED tokens and minted the first Deeds of the WoM. Since day one, the protocol had built-in incentives to reward them with more MEED tokens. They also earn substantial influence in shaping the future of the WoM through governance tokens.

Organizations acquiring but especially using Deeds to engage and reward their employees would get compensated in minted MEED. The fairer they will play, the more they will get. The earlier adopters would be associated with the first historic cities and later recognized as the founding builders.

Organizations can, of course, participate in liquidity pools but also join the community of builders and get additional engagement rewards there.

## 5.3. The launch

The official launch of the WoM was purposedly scheduled for **May 1st, 2022** – International Workers Day, celebrated in many countries.

At that time, the MEED token already existed. It was possible to acquire it, and liquidity pools are open for participation on Polygon and Ethereum networks.

The primary protocol for Inverstor's incentives is available on Ethereum Mainnet. At launch, it included staking, liquidity rewards, minting points accumulation, and redeeming of Deeds.

The Builders community is up and running and open to anyone wanting to join, test, and participate. It is possible to log in with Metamask.


## 5.4. The Builders Community

We are launching the Meeds DAO community on the Builders Hub [builders.meeds.io] and Discord. The community welcomes anyone who wants to participate in the WoM building. The DAO will reward any builders' engagement with MEED tokens.

The Builders' Hub participates in the user engagement minting like any other hub and thus receives. It aspires to be an exemplary community and inspire others to set better standards of working together to create value and a positive impact on the world.

## 5.5. Roadmap and milestones

Our roadmap would follow the priority order below:

- Engagement index and minting through engagement
- Enable Deeds renting
- Xeed creation
- Badges improvement and credentials development
- DeFi services – in the wallet, credit card partnership

During the building stage, we are counting on the early adopters from the DAOs and tech-savvy companies. We should also have some early adopters from traditional companies that gain immediate value from the WoM by providing relevant engagement programs to their people on top of their current conventional compensation plans.

MEED minting spans 20 years. By then, we aspire to have built a mature ecosystem, spreading it to many organizations and workers globally.
