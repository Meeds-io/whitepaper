## Abstract

The current labor market is inefficient due to high transaction costs and frequent conflicts of interest between employers and employees. Completing work-related activities can be costly and time-consuming, and there are often disagreements or conflicting interests between those who hire workers and the workers themselves.

The World of Meeds (WoM) proposes a new paradigm for solving these problems by reducing transaction costs and reinventing working relationships. It's a digital space that bridges the gap between traditional businesses and new forms of organization, thanks to a fair and transparent system of incentives that realigns everyone's interests.

## Introduction

The current labor market situation does not satisfy either workers or employers[^1][^2][^3]. 

Many workers have difficulty finding suitable employment opportunities. Indeed, the job market tends to favor specific individuals and miss out on valuable skills due to various human prejudices about race, gender, disability, introversion, and much more.

Furthermore, there is a lack of transparency regarding what jobs are really available and the actual working conditions.  Once hired, workers often have little say in their working hours, location, content or methods. In addition, the lack of transparency in remuneration rules generates a feeling of inequity. Career advancement and compensation are too often dependent on the good faith and objectivity of a direct manager, leading to a lack of trust and cooperation.

Employers, for their part, face difficulties in finding talent, recruiting the right skills, and integrating them into the right positions at the right time. Current recruitment methods do not allow us to objectively and efficiently determine the suitability of a potential future employee. The result is high turnover rates and poor employee loyalty. All this contributes to high recruitment and integration costs.

These problems are linked to high transaction costs and the aggravation of the agent-principal problem[^4]. Although, with the advent of the Internet, labor markets are evolving towards greater uniformity and transparency, transaction costs[^5] have yet to be reduced without any element of objectivity.

The WoM offers a unique approach to decentralized working, tackling many common problems that plague traditional working paradigms.

Thanks to its work paradigm modeled as transparent, objective incentives, WoM transforms workers into free contributors whose interests are aligned with those of the organizations where they exercise their talents. It smoothes out hierarchies, encourages the sharing of value by promoting operating modes that sustainably create value for organizations.

By revealing everyone's skills objectively and continuously, WoM overcomes the lack of transparency in the job market and ensures that top talent is not overlooked.

WoM rethinks the employer/employee relationship, inviting organizations to create fulfilling and stimulating working conditions, with fair rewards for the value they build together. This model encourages free contributors to be more engaged, creative, and authentic, which in turn translates into greater productivity and innovation for the organization.

With these sustainable ways of operating that create value for all, WoM breaks with traditional corporate organizational models and paves the way for emerging models such as DAO[^6]. WoM aims to be global and inclusive, transcending geographies and business sectors. Resolutely decentralized, its vocation is to support the activities of millions of organizations and billions of workers. As a testament to future generations, the WoM has been imagined as a public good incorporating virtuous mechanisms to encourage long-term interest and avoid any form of cartelization.

Through WoM, Meeds expresses its mission to build a future of work in which organizations of all types provide inclusive and fulfilling work environments, and where everyone is rewarded with a fair share of the value they help create through to their active and authentic participation.
