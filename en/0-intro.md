## Abstract

The current work market is inefficient due to high transaction costs and frequent conflicts of interest between employers and employees. 

The World of Meeds (WoM) proposes a new paradigm to address these issues by reducing transaction costs and reinventing working relationships. It's a digital platform that bridges the gap between traditional companies and new forms of organization by introducing a fair and transparent incentive system that realigns the interests of all parties.

## Introduction

The current state of the work market fails to satisfy both workers and employers[^1][^2][^3]. 

Workers face difficulties in finding suitable job opportunities, as the job market tends to favor specific individuals, leaving great skill sets behind due to various human biases such as race, gender, disability, introversion, and more. 

Additionally, there is a lack of transparency in available positions and employment conditions. Once employed, workers often have little say in their work hours, workplace, content, or methods. Moreover, there is a perceived lack of fairness in compensation rules due to the lack of transparency surrounding them. Career progress and compensation depend on the immediate manager's good faith and objectivity, leading to a lack of trust and cooperation. 

Employers face challenges in sourcing talent, hiring the right skills, and fitting them into the right jobs at the right time. The traditional hiring pool often fails to provide an objective way to determine a potential contributor's skills. High turnover rates and a lack of contributor loyalty can also increase hiring and onboarding costs. 

All of these issues boil down to high transaction costs and the exacerbated agent-principal problem[^4]. Despite the evolution of job markets towards more unity and transparency with the internet, transaction costs[^5] still need to be lowered without an objectivity element. 

The WoM offers a unique approach to decentralized work, which aims to address several issues prevalent in traditional work paradigms.

Through its transparent, objective, and decentralized incentive paradigm, the WoM aligns the interests of contributors and employers sustainably. It proposes ways to flatten hierarchies and open up ownership, promoting sustainable ways to operate and create value for organizations.

By matching jobs and skills objectively, quickly, and globally, the WoM aims to address the lack of transparency in the job market and ensure that great skill sets are not left behind. 

The WoM aims to reinvent the employer/employee relationship by introducing a transparent, objective, and decentralized incentive paradigm. This incentivizes contributors to be more engaged, creative, and productive, leading to greater innovation and productivity. 

By bridging the gap between traditional corporations and newer organizational models like DAOs[^6], the WoM provides sustainable ways to operate and create value for all. As a decentralized venture, the WoM gains value exponentially as more people use it. Therefore, we have designed its protocol as a public good with built-in mechanisms to encourage long-term interest and avoid cartelization. 

The WoM is an open paradigm that welcomes active, creative participation from everyone.
