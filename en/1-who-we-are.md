# 1. About Us

Meeds is a cooperative effort led by diverse communities envisioning a decentralized digital world that resists centralized control and promotes freedom and fairness.

Leveraging the Ethereum ecosystem, we implement the WoM protocols and oversee the supply of the MEED token. This strategy has enabled us to prioritize safety, accessibility, and user-friendliness and ensure profitability for as many people as possible. We are committed to maintaining the trust and confidence of our users in the safety and profitability of our protocols.

The legal entity behind Meeds is the _Meeds Association_, a non-profit organization registered under Swiss law in Geneva. It is responsible for regulating and issuing MEED tokens and contracting with service providers.

The Meeds Association intends to gradually hand over control of the protocol and treasury to the _Meeds DAO_. This autonomous, decentralized organization represents the ecosystem's decentralized governance arm, enabling the community to participate in decision-making, voting on proposals, and upgrading the protocol.

The Association and the DAO differ in how they interact with the real world.

The Meeds Association is a conventional organization comprising members and a Board of Directors. It operates within specific legal and regulatory frameworks. In practical terms, it carries out activities such as organizing events, providing services, and defending the interests of its members, if necessary, via a staffed physical office.

In contrast, the DAO operates without a central authority, making decisions by consensus of its members using blockchain-based voting mechanisms. It can also engage in activities such as project financing, asset management, and decision execution via smart contracts.

The WoM is built with open-source software([github.com/meeds-io](https://github.com/meeds-io)) and is hosted by partners selected by the Meeds Association on behalf of Meeds DAO.
