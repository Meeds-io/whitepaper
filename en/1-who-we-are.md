# 1. About Us

Meeds is a cooperative effort led by diverse communities envisioning a decentralized digital world that resists centralized control and promotes freedom and fairness.

We rely on the Ethereum ecosystem to implement the WoM as a public good accessible to as many people as possible. This strategy has allowed us to prioritize security, accessibility and user-friendliness and to ensure profitability for as many people as possible. We are committed to maintaining our users' trust in the security and cost-effectiveness of our protocols.

Meeds is legally registered as a non-profit organization under the Swiss jurisdiction of the canton of Geneva under the name _Association Meeds_. The association is initially responsible for regulating and issuing MEED tokens, as well as contracting with service providers.

The Meeds Association intends to gradually cede control of Meeds' protocol and finances to a DAO. The Meeds DAO is an autonomous organization that leverages decentralized governance mechanisms to give decision-making power to the community on topics like finances and protocol upgrades (i.e. the computer code that governs its operation).

By nature, the association and the DAO do not interact in the same way with the world, but their activities are complementary and they contribute to a shared mission.

The Meeds Association is a conventional organization under Swiss law under the legal status of an association composed of company members. It operates within a legal regulatory framework and is overseen by a board of directors called the Committee. It may have offices and staff to carry out its activities. Concretely, it carries out activities such as the provision of services, the organization of events, and legal procedures to defend the interests of Meeds.

On the other hand, the DAO operates without a physical establishment or central authority. It may also engage in activities such as project financing, asset management and decision execution through smart contracts.

The WoM software code is open source ([github.com/meeds-io](https://github.com/meeds-io)) and hosted by partners selected by the Meeds Association on behalf of Meeds DAO.
