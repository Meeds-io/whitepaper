# 1. About Us

Meeds is a cooperative effort led by various open-source software (OSS) communities dedicated to creating a decentralized digital world that resists centralized corporate control and promotes a free and open environment.

Utilizing the Ethereum ecosystem, we implement the WoM protocols and oversee the supply of the MEED token. This strategy has enabled us to prioritize security, accessibility, usability, and cost-effectiveness, rendering it appealing to a diverse user demographic. Nevertheless, we designed the WoM as an autonomous and self-sufficient public good with aspirations to expand across multiple chains.

The legal entity behind Meeds is the _Meeds Association_, a non-profit organization registered under Swiss law in Geneva. It is responsible for regulating the issuance of MEED tokens and contracting with service providers. 

The Meeds Association intends to progressively hand over control of the Meeds protocol and treasuries to the _Meeds DAO_. This decentralized autonomous organization represents the decentralized governance arm of the ecosystem, empowering the community to participate in decision-making, proposal voting, and protocol upgrades.

The relationship between the association and the DAO involves how they operate in the real world. 

The Meeds Association is a conventional organization with members and a board of directors. It operates under specific legal and regulatory frameworks. In practical terms, it engages in activities like organizing events, providing services, and advocating for members, possibly maintaining a physical office with staff.

In contrast, the Meeds DAO functions without a central authority, making decisions through the consensus of its members using blockchain-based voting mechanisms. It may also engage in activities such as funding projects, managing assets, and executing decisions through smart contracts.

The WoM is built as open-source software ([github.com/meeds-io](https://github.com/meeds-io)) and hosted by partners selected by the Meeds Association on behalf of the Meeds DAO.
