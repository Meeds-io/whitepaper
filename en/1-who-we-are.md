# 1. About Us

Meeds represents a collective initiative, championed by a diverse group of Open Source Software (OSS) communities, united by the vision of a decentralized digital world. This vision counters the dominance of centralized mega-corporations, advocating for a free and open digital environment.

The legal entity behind Meeds is the Meeds Association, a non-profit organization incorporated under Swiss law in Geneva. It is responsible for regulating the issuance of the Meeds token, an ERC20 token recognized as a utility token.

The Meeds project utilizes the Ethereum and Polygon blockchain to implement the World of Meeds (WoM) and the Meeds token. This approach prioritizes accessibility, user-friendliness, and cost-effectiveness, making it appealing to a broad user base.

Functioning as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), Meeds emphasizes democratic governance. Token holders with governance rights participate in key decisions, including annual board elections, ensuring transparency and community involvement in organizational changes.


Apart from overseeing the Meeds token, the project also encompasses the Intellectual Property (IP) of the Meeds Open Source Software, which is the foundational technology for the community Hubs in the WoM. This software is accessible on [github.com/meeds-io](https://github.com/meeds-io). Additionally, the Meeds infrastructure includes a cloud platform that hosts these Hubs, furthering the project's commitment to fostering a vibrant, decentralized digital community.
