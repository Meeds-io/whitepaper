# 4. Xeeds - Work Metaverse Individuals / users

## 4.1. Decentralized and self-sovereign models

WoM priznava zasebnost kot temeljno človekovo pravico in uporabnikom omogoča, da si lastijo svoje podatke.

Naš pristop temelji na načelih decentralizirane in suverene identitete, kar uporabnikom omogoča, da imajo kadar koli nadzor nad tem, katere podatke želijo objaviti, deliti z omejeno skupino ali ohraniti zasebne.

User's activity and engagement in the WoM is always linked to a Deed. A Xeed is the virtual persona of a user in a Deed. Xeed does not require any KYC, it is self-declaring, but we could conceivably imagine third-party firms providing this service.

## 4.2. Badges and credentials

Badges and Credentials are given to users as a part of their participation in a Deed. The holder may download them as W3C Verifiable Credentials[^7][^8] (aka VCs) and store them in his wallet. Those VCs are proof of knowledge/know-how certified by the organization issuing it.

In today’s world, it is hard to prove a skill beforehand. When people advertise themselves on networks, they count on their managers to give them a recommendation. The latter supposes certain goodwill on the part of the manager but is not necessarily treated as proof by the future employer.

Metaverse za delo zagotavlja bolj pregledno in nespremenljivo sredstvo, s katerim lahko ljudje pridobivajo in dokazujejo svoje sposobnosti.

Badges are used to represent accomplishments made within a Deed. After completing a set of objectives or challenges, users will be awarded points. Badges can be unlocked by accumulating certain amounts of points in specific categories.

Ko uporabnik prenese značke, je mogoče vključiti število točk in njegovo uvrstitev v Deed za ta poseben dosežek.

Credentials are more flexible than Badges; they could be a recommendation from a peer, indicating years of expertise, a training or exam completion, or engagement in the Deed. These are signed by the Deed and can be accompanied by a signature by a peer user.

## 4.3. Digital work identity

All of the above contributes to forming proven digital skillset that can be kept and used by the user when changing jobs or freelancing. It would be more trustworthy than traditional solutions as it relies on not just one individual but a full community to prove it.

Podobno kot v denarnici Meeds bo uporabnik ohranil svoj Xeed, značke in pooblastila, ki so mu priloženi, v svoji identitetni denarnici, ko bo prehajal iz enega Deeda v drugega, iz enega mesta v drugo, kjer koli v WoM.

Uporabnik bo lahko delil svoj Xeed, značke in pooblastila z drugimi Deeds, da bi poudaril svoje izkušnje, pa tudi z zaposlovalci ali drugimi službami, ki se mu zdijo zanimive.

A user can have one or several digital identities in the WoM. He could later present them in a unified way using verified presentations.

Contrary to web 2, the user is in full ownership of his decentralized identities. The latter can show (and prove) the Deeds he participated in, his proven skills, his claimed skills, other Xeeds (people) whom he worked with, his digital representation of himself... In a manner of trustworthy LinkedIn 3.0.

The user will be able to select whether or not to reveal anything, what information to provide, and which identities to use for each position. The content (proven skill, previous Deeds, etc.) is tamper proof and so could not be modified. Any identity would have to be developed over time.

## 4.4. Fair work marketplace

Within this paradigm the future work marketplace allows users to move freely and allocate/sell their engagement among the Deeds – as they do in the physical world by changing employers. However, in the WoM their engagement would be tangible, measured and rewarded in a fair way. By moving between systems that follow a similar logic, they will better understand the rules of the game and will judge employers fairly – grass is not always greener elsewhere. Users will be able to choose which Deed provides better engagement reward conditions, belongs to a more attractive city, etc.

On their end, the Deeds’ holders/renters can search for relevant skills using the WoM network of digital work identities (that the users decided to disclose). They will be able to source skills more effectively, based on verified and detailed information on work history, work skills and engagement level of the user.

## 4.5. Tangible and transparent recognition

Today, details on compensation and bonuses are obscure in many workplaces. Therefore, it is difficult for a person to compare his conditions to that of another and get a sense of a fair and unbiased treatment. Employees experience a lot of frustrations with the above.

Sistem WoM uvaja objektiven način priznavanja dosežkov in njihovega nagrajevanja.

Mehanizem priznavanja in nagrajevanja dosežkov je pregleden in se pravično uporablja za vse uporabnike po enakih izrecnih pravilih, ki so vnaprej določena in usklajena s cilji Deedu.

Denarnice so individualne in temeljijo na verigi blokov - ko uporabnik prejme nagrado ali pridobi značko, je ni mogoče vzeti nazaj ali izbrisati.

## 4.6. Access to Web 3.0, cryptoeconomy and DEFI services

Kot smo že omenili, Metaverse Dela odpira svet kriptovalut in decentraliziranih spletnih storitev pravzaprav vsakomur - zelo veliki populaciji uporabnikov, po možnosti celo nepovezanih z digitalnim področjem.

Indeed, any work engagement can potentially be tokenized. In fact the world is becoming increasingly digital with trends such as 5G, iot, wearables and so forth. As a consequence, potentially more and more signals could be captured and analysed to tokenize the engagement of non-digital professions. Challenges provide a ready to go way to tokenize it by representing achievements in the physical world.

Vsak uporabnik lahko dobi Meeds in uporabi denarnico Meeds za dostop do novodobnih storitev brez posebnega usposabljanja.
