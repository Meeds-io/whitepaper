# 1. Qui sommes-nous?

Meeds is a cooperative effort led by various open-source software (OSS) communities dedicated to creating a decentralized digital world that resists centralized corporate control and promotes a free and open environment.

Utilizing the Ethereum ecosystem, we implement the WoM protocols and oversee the supply of the MEED token. This strategy has enabled us to prioritize security, accessibility, usability, and cost-effectiveness, rendering it appealing to a diverse user demographic. Nevertheless, we designed the WoM as an autonomous and self-sufficient public good with aspirations to expand across multiple chains.

L'entité juridique derrière Meeds est l'_Association Meeds_, une organisation à but non lucratif enregistrée en droit suisse à Genève. Elle est responsable de la régulation et de l'émission des jetons MEED, ainsi que de contractualiser avec les fournisseurs de services.

The Meeds Association intends to progressively hand over control of the Meeds protocol and treasuries to the _Meeds DAO_. This decentralized autonomous organization represents the decentralized governance arm of the ecosystem, empowering the community to participate in decision-making, proposal voting, and protocol upgrades.

The relationship between the association and the DAO involves how they operate in the real world.

L'Association Meeds est une organisation conventionnelle composée de membres et d'un conseil d'administration. It operates under specific legal and regulatory frameworks. In practical terms, it engages in activities like organizing events, providing services, and advocating for members, possibly maintaining a physical office with staff.

In contrast, the Meeds DAO functions without a central authority, making decisions through the consensus of its members using blockchain-based voting mechanisms. It may also engage in activities such as funding projects, managing assets, and executing decisions through smart contracts.

Le WoM est construit en mode open source ([github.com/meeds-io](https://github.com/meeds-io)). Le logiciel est hébergé par des partenaires sélectionnés par l'Association Meeds pour le compte de Meeds DAO.
