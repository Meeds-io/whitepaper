# 5. Résumé de la Vision et Feuille de Route

## 5.1. Decentralized Work for Everyone

Ultimately, the WoM is a decentralized workplace for everyone – every person and all organizations.

It will be populated by users, acting through their digital identities and accessing the world through their Metamask for crypto-savvies or login/password for the newbies.

People would allocate their time and be rewarded fairly and transparently for their work. They would get access to the decentralized world and the crypto world quickly and familiarly - they would get simple tools to use their tokens in their lives or invest in them for their future.

Organizations will more efficiently source talents, browsing through the WoM for the right proven skills. The "Mintium" tokens will reward them for creating the conditions of genuine engagement and participation. But above all, they would benefit from higher engagement and loyalty from their contributors.

The WoM has its currency,  the **MEED** –  to spend in stores, swap with other currencies, invest, rent or buy, etc. The WoM also facilitates distributing other tokens and participating in the global crypto ecosystem.

As a picture is worth a thousand words, here is a diagram that describes the WoM and MEED token flows:

The WoM will raise taxes on the generated value to ensure its long-term availability and sustainability.


## 5.2. Stratégies d'Investissement

The diagram below represents an example of the **Meeds investment strategy for capital holders** :

Organizations can, of course, participate in liquidity pools but also join the community of builders and get additional engagement rewards there.

## 5.3. Le lancement

The official launch of the WoM was purposedly scheduled for **May 1st, 2022** – International Workers Day, celebrated in many countries.

À cette époque, le jeton MEED existait déjà. It was possible to acquire it, and liquidity pools are open for participation on Polygon and Ethereum networks.

The primary protocol for Inverstor's incentives is available on Ethereum Mainnet. Au lancement, il comprenait la mise en jeu, les récompenses de liquidité, l'accumulation de points de frappe et la génération des Deeds.

The Builders community is up and running and open to anyone wanting to join, test, and participate. It is possible to log in with Metamask.

## 5.4. Avantages pour les Primo-adoptants

Early adopters get considerable advantages over the latecomers.

En particulier, le WoM récompense les investissements à long terme – la génération des Deeds. Le propriétaire original d'un Deed se voit indemnisé en jetons de Mintium (cas de l'utilisation active) ou par le biais d'un revenu passif (cas de la location) et perçoit un revenu perpétuel de 1% sur toute vente future du Deed (à chaque changement de propriété, il perçoit des frais sur la transaction).

Early investors have participated in the liquidity pools to support the Meeds project. Ils ont également mis en jeu leurs jetons MEED et ont généré les premiers Deeds. Since day one, the protocol had built-in incentives to reward them. They also earn substantial influence in the DAO through governance tokens.

Les organisations utilisant Deeds et jouant à un jeu équitable pour engager et récompenser leurs contributeurs gagnent des jetons MEED. The earlier adopters will be associated with the first historic cities and later recognized as the founding builders.


## 5.5. The Builders Community

We have launched the Meeds DAO community on the [Builders Hub](builders.meeds.io) and [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/7d9Byf4Fz6). The community welcomes anyone who wants to participate in the WoM building. The DAO will reward any builders' engagement with MEED tokens.

The Builders' Hub participates in the user engagement minting like any other hub and thus receives. It aspires to be an exemplary community and inspire others to set better standards of working together to create value and a positive impact on the world.

## 5.6. Roadmap and Milestones

Notre feuille de route suivra l'ordre de priorité ci-dessous :

- Indice d'engagement et émission par engagement
- Activer la location des Deeds
- Création des Xeeds
- Amélioration des badges et développement des titres de compétences
- DeFi services – in the wallet, credit card partnership

During the building stage, we rely on early adopters from the DAOs and tech-savvy companies. Additionally, we anticipate early adopters from traditional companies benefiting immediately from the WoM. They can enhance engagement programs for their employees alongside existing compensation plans.

MEED minting spans 20 years. We aspire to develop a mature ecosystem and extend its reach to numerous organizations and workers worldwide.
