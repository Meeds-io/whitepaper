# 4. Xeeds - Les Citoyens

## 4.1. Identité Souveraine

We recognize privacy as a fundamental human right and empower users to own their data.

Our approach is based on decentralized and self-sovereign identity principles, allowing users to control what information they want to publicize, share with a restricted group, or keep private.

Users engage within various communities; we call their virtual persona a **__Xeed__**.

Xeeds are self-declarative and require no default KYC (__Know Your Customer__) process.

However, communities that need it can hire third-party firms providing this service or use protocols such as __Proof of Humanity__.

## 4.2. Jetons de Reconnaissance

In today's world, it is hard to prove a skill beforehand. When people advertise themselves on networks, they depend on social reputation. Typically, a manager or peer provides a recommendation. It requires goodwill from the relative but rarely constitutes definitive proof for the future employer.

Users may earn Badges and Credentials when participating within their Community Hubs . We will let them store them also in a wallet or download them as Verifiable Credentials [^7][^8]. Such credentials are proof of knowledge/know-how certified by the issuing organization.

With this, we offer a transparent and immutable means for people to acquire and demonstrate their abilities.

**Badges** Badges represent accomplishments made within a community. By completing work tasks, users earn points. They can earn recognition badges as they accumulate points and reach certain thresholds.

Badges will be representable as NFTs of NTTs (Non Transferable Tokens, aka __Soulbound__ tokens) or downloadable. They will include selectively disclosed information such as the name of the Hub, the number of points, the category of work, and the date of achievement or the rank in the community.

**Credentials** Credentials are more flexible than Badges. They could be a recommendation from a peer, indicating years of expertise, a training or exam completion, or engagement in the space.

The Hub or peer members will sign these credentials to endorse them officially and verifiably.

## 4.3. Identité Numérique du Travailleur

All of the above contributes to forming a proven digital skillset that users can keep and use when changing jobs or freelancing. It is more trustworthy than traditional solutions because it relies on an entire community to prove it.

Users will retain their Xeed, Badges, and Credentials across Hubs. They can thus advertise, show, and prove their skills and experience to other community leaders and recruiters or any other services they deem interesting.

People develop a composite digital identity over time as they work. Anyone can own several digital identities that they could decide to reconcile later. They have total freedom to select whether or not to reveal anything, what information to provide, and which identities to use for each position.

We advocate for Citizens of the WoM to own their decentralized identity fully.

## 4.4. Fair Work Marketplace

Within this paradigm, the future work marketplace allows users to move freely and allocate/sell their engagement among the Hubs – as they do in the physical world by changing employers. However, in the WoM, their engagement is tangible, measured, and rewarded fairly.

By moving between systems that follow a similar logic, they will better understand the game's rules and can evaluate their potential employers. The engagement scores give them a hint about the activity level and reward conditions in the community.

On their side, the community leaders can search for relevant skills using the network of digital work identities (that the users decided to disclose). They can source skills more effectively based on verified and detailed information on work history, work skills, and user engagement level.

## 4.5. Tangible and Transparent Recognition

Today, details on compensation and bonuses are opaque in many workplaces. Therefore, it is difficult for a person to compare his conditions to another and get a sense of fair and unbiased treatment. Les employés éprouvent ainsi beaucoup de frustration.

The WoM introduces objectivity in how their achievements will be recognized and rewarded.

The engagement recognition and reward mechanism is transparent and applies equitably to all users, following the same explicit rules, decided in advance, and aligned with the community goals.

Thanks to blockchain technology, taking back earned rewards and badges is impossible.

## 4.6. Accessibilité à la DeFi

The WoM opens the world of cryptocurrency and decentralized web services to anyone – a substantial population of workers, even possibly unrelated to the digital field.

En effet, la tokenisation de l'engagement s'applique à tout travail. The world is becoming increasingly digital with trends such as 5G, IoT, wearables, etc.

Over time, the WoM will capture more and more work signals from low-digitalized professions. Engagement programs offer a pre-designed solution to convert real-world accomplishments into virtual tokens.

Anybody can earn tokens through their Meeds wallet and easily access various DeFi services with low entry friction.
