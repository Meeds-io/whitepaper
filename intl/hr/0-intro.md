Današnjem tržištu rada nedostaje učinkovitosti zbog visokih transakcijskih troškova\[^1\]\[^2\]<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref">3</5></sup> te čestim sukobima interesa između poslodavca i zaposlenika.</p>

  Work Metaverse (Wome) predlaže novu paradigmu koja bi smanjila transakcijske troškove i ponovno osmislila radni odnos, premošćujući jaz između tradicionalnih korporacija i DAO-ova.

  The work market today is broken. It fails to satisfy both employees and employers.
</p>

<p spaces-before="0">
  On the employee side, it is difficult to find the right jobs. The job market favors certain types of individuals, leaving great skill sets behind. This comes from a set of human biases – racial based, gender based, handicap based, introvert based etc. The work market also lacks transparency as to the available positions and employment conditions.
</p>

<p spaces-before="0">
  Once employed, employee’s personal liberties are infringed upon in exchange for compensation. Employees have little say in their work hours, workplace, work content or work methods. And their compensation is rarely linked to their real implication or value. Compensation rules lack transparency and, hence, are perceived as unfair. Moreover, compensation and career progress are also dependent on the human factor – the employee immediate manager’s good faith and objectivity.
</p>

<p spaces-before="0">
  Employers, on the other hand, experience difficulties at sourcing talent and hiring the right skills and the right fit at the right time for the job. There is no objective way to ascertain the potential hire’s skills or source people outside of the employer’s traditional hiring pool.
</p>

<p spaces-before="0">
  Poslodavci se također suočavaju s nedostatkom lojalnosti svojih zaposlenika i velikom fluktuacijom, što oboje povećava troškove zapošljavanja i stažiranja.
</p>

<p spaces-before="0">
  Moreover, employers also face low engagement in their existing employees, leading to low creativity, productivity and innovation. The latter inflicts all the more damage in today’s economy requiring more skilled creative work.

  Sve gore navedeno svodi se na visoke transakcijske troškove i pogoršani problem agent-principal<fnref target="4" /> :
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    With Internet, job markets did evolve towards more unity and transparency thanks to job posting sites, career sites, etc. But transactions costs are still too high in the absence of objectivity element.
  </li>
  <li>
    Što se tiče problema agent-principal, on je složen sve većim jazom u prihodima i bogatstvu između zaposlenika i dioničara te rigidnošću odnosa poslodavac-zaposlenik.
  </li>
</ul>

  WoM ima za cilj riješiti oboje kroz novu decentraliziranu radnu paradigmu.
</p>

<p spaces-before="0">
  Following R. Coase’s works<fnref target="5" />, most economists link the concept of enterprise with the necessity to mitigate transaction costs. Internet and more recently blockchain and web3 open exciting possibilities in lowering transaction costs everywhere, reinventing economy and in particular reinventing the enterprise. The first DAOs<fnref target="6" /> started this process focusing on lowering the cost of transactions for capital sourcing and governance. The WoM aims at pushing this logic further by lowering the cost of work transactions. It proposes a decentralized world where jobs and skills matching could be done objectively, quickly and globally.
</p>

<p spaces-before="0">
  The first DAOs flatten the hierarchies and open ownership. The WoM pursues this logic by reinventing rather than suppressing the employer/employee relationship. It introduces a transparent, objective and decentralized reward paradigm, that would sustainably align the employer and the employee interests.
</p>

<p spaces-before="0">
  Finally, the Work Metaverse bridges the gap between corporations and the DAOs. On one hand, it introduces traditional corporations into the decentralized world through an easy to apply engagement rewarding paradigm, complementing their compensation systems. On the other hand, it proposes sustainable ways to operate and create value for DAOs. Ultimately, the WoM could be among the first mainstream applications to democratize the use of the blockchain for every company and every employee – including non-digital ones.
</p>

<p spaces-before="0">
  As with any decentralized venture, the WoM proposal gains in value exponentially as more people use it. For that reason, founders took great care to encourage long term interest and avoid monopolizing the WoM benefits, whether short term or long term. It is an open paradigm, still to be built, and open to active creative participation from everyone.
