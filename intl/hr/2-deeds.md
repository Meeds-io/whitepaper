# 2. Deeds NFT - Work Metaverse Organizations

## 2.1. NFT – Deeds defined

A non fungible token (NFT) is a unique token that represents a good. In the WoM, a Deed is used as a title of ownership. Each Deed gives its owner a right to access several services - for instance, an access to a digital office, powered by the Meeds software and the right to mint Meeds.

The WoM welcomes all kinds of organizations - DAOs, traditional corporations, associations, think tanks, partnerships, theatre companies, project groups, schools etc. The Deed represents their digital existence in the WoM.

## 2.2. Deeds supply

The WoM will ultimately supply a limited amount of Deeds. Each Deed includes a predefined maximum number of users and offers a capacity of Meeds rewarding (Minting Power). The term ‘user’ here and hereafter designates any type of employee, worker, freelancer, volunteer etc.

Postoje četiri vrste Deeds, od kojih svaki pruža različite mogućnosti u smislu broja korisnika, prava glasa u gradu (vidi 2.7) ili Meeds moći kovanja, a najrjeđi je najmoćniji:

| **Deed Vrsta** | **Max users** | **Snaga kovanja** | **Oskudica** | **Gradsko pravo glasa** |
| -------------- | ------------- | ----------------- | ------------ | ----------------------- |
| Uobičajen      | 100           | 1                 | ~ 90%        | 1                       |
| Neuobičajeno   | 1000          | 1.1               | ~ 9%         | 10                      |
| Rijetko        | 10 000        | 1.3               | ~ 1%         | 100                     |
| Legendarno     | neograničen   | 2                 | < 0.1 %      | 1000                    |

## 2.3. Deeds ownership

Deed daje vlasniku pravo da je KORISTI, IZNAJMLJUJE ili PRODAJE.

- KORIŠTENJE – Vlasnici Deed mogu koristiti Deed izravno za svoju organizaciju, pružajući usluge svojim korisnicima.
- NAJAM - Vlasnici Deed također mogu iznajmiti Deed drugoj organizaciji kako bi ostvarili pasivni prihod.
- PRODAJ - Deed se može prodati na sekundarnom tržištu kao što je [OpenSea](https://opensea.io).

Budući da je aktivni nositelj ili iznajmljivač Deed, organizacija je nagrađena Meeds, kroz inovativni "mintium" model opisan u nastavku (dio 2.6).

## 2.4. Deeds services, engagement/rewards engine

In an increasingly competitive market, in order to attract and retain talents and maximize their input, organizations need to incentivize their users beyond simple compensation. The WoM provides an innovative framework to do that by tokenizing work engagement.

Each Deed’s holder or renter can provide tools and services to its users, who earn engagement points that can be fine-tuned to the Deed’s priorities. Periodically, points are converted into Meeds (and - for DAOs - potentially another token), based on the Deed’s set budget. In that manner, users’ engagement in activities that matter to the organization is rewarded.

Za početak, za nagrađivanje angažmana mogu se koristiti sljedeće besplatne usluge udruge Meeds:

- **Gamification engine** – automatske radnje unutar WoM-a imaju težinu u bodovima, koje se mogu fino prilagoditi prioritetima Deeda putem prilagodljivih programa angažmana.
- **Challenges** – customizable challenges can be set up to represent achievements. Challenges are preset by one person and can be full-filled and announced as such by another. Challenges carry a weight in points, within customizable engagement programs.
- **Customizable engagement programs** - organizations can create their own engagement programs matching their business goals and priorities. Programs are associated to automatic actions within the system and manually set challenges. Each program has a set Meeds budget. Periodically points earned by each user through automatics or announced actions in each engagement program are converted into Meeds, based on that program’s budget.
- **Kudos** - kudos can be awarded by users to each other, as a thank you and a token of recognition. As kudos available to distribute are limited (a preset periodic limit, 3 per week for instance), they are rare and valuable. Like actions, kudos carry points. This way employees are empowered to reward their colleagues.
- Alati **Suradnje**, uključeni u sustav nagrađivanja – radni prostori, asinkrona komunikacija, alat za upravljanje zadacima i bilješke – omogućuju ljudima da rade zajedno na projektima.
- **Wallet** – users are provided with a secure Ethereum technology wallet to store their Meeds. Alternatively, for advanced users, a Metamask wallet can be used.
- **Store** – trgovina u kojoj se Meeds može zamijeniti za povlastice koje pruža vlasnik ili unajmljivač ugovora ili ekosustav Meeds.
- **Analytics** – za analizu i praćenje angažmana unutar Djela.
- **Connectors**, uključeni u sustav nagrađivanja – korisnici dobivaju bodove angažmana putem radnji u drugom softveru – na primjer za uvrštavanje koda u GitHub.

Some of the afore-mentioned tools and services are already decentralized, others are not. The ultimate goal is to provide all services in a decentralized manner, which we will do gradually as the underlying technology evolves.

New services can be plugged into the reward engine through APIs. Examples are countless and can include virtually any software or service:

- CRM softver – prodavači bi dobili bodove angažmana za rad na prilikama.
- Računovodstveni softver – računovođe bi dobile bodove angažmana za vođenje poslovnih knjiga.
- Terminal za mjerenje vremena – tvornički radnik može dobiti bodove za radno vrijeme u tvornici.
- Itd.

Furthermore, engagement produced via the connector participates in the organization’s global engagement score which is a factor of the Meeds minting distribution, described below. In order to do that, the connector needs to be whitelisted by the Meeds Association. The association reviews the connector, approves of its algorithm and acquires its ownership against Meeds. It then becomes part of the free services provided by the association and is included in the global engagement index. Any other Deed can use the same connector and the same reward algorithm for its developers.

The Deed’s holder or renter can enrich its store with its own perks, connect to an online perks offer etc. There again the possibilities are endless:

- Tečajevi obuke
- Članarine u teretani
- Paketi za odmor
- Ručak s voditeljem organizacije
- Fizički uredski prostor
- Itd.

Trgovina funkcionira korištenjem Meedsa tako da se Meedovi djelomično vraćaju u Deed.

## 2.5. Rewards – Meeds and other tokens

The WoM will tokenize users engagement, by gamifying digital work tools, and attributing points and Meeds in relation to work engagement. Services plugged into the engagement and reward engine attribute points to each user, according to their engagement level and in line with each Deed’s engagement programs. Indeed, each Deed can fine-tune the amount of points given for each type of activity. Thus, pushing some code in GitHub may be worth 10 points for an IT shop, while a digital agency may attribute only 5 points for GitHub pushes but would offer 10 points for retweets.

Periodically, the rewarding engine converts engagement points into Meeds according to budgets and other distribution rules and ultimately rewards the users via their wallets. The Deed is not required to distribute Meeds and can use the engagement system to enable some other form of compensation program. However, distributing Meeds will improve its minting capacity.

Štoviše, Deed ne mora nužno kupiti Meeds kako bi ih distribuirao i poticao svoje programe angažmana, jer će dobiti Meedsa iz modela "mintium", opisanog u nastavku.

In addition to Meeds, it will also be possible to distribute other tokens (for instance the DAO’s own tokens) based on the same engagement mechanism. In that case, the distribution will be subject to a 5% transaction fee (in DAO token) for the Meeds Association.

## 2.6. The “mintium” model – tokenize work engagement

Uključivanjem svojih korisnika u WoM, Deeds dobiva naknadu kroz inovativni mintium model.

Engagement points, gained by the Deeds’ users, participate in the global engagement index, calculated by the Meeds Association. The index uses the same principle for all Deeds. Even though the Deed can change the points’ allocation to promote one action over another, those changes will not be taken into the account in the global index computation.

Each week, a certain amount of Meeds is allocated to the global engagement minting of the WoM. It’s computed weekly, pro-rata, among the participating Deeds. Some Deeds get an additional boost depending on their type. The Deeds that claim their Meeds over the week, receive them. The unclaimed Meeds are added to the following week’s global distribution amount.

Ocjena angažmana _S_ Deed-a je funkcija angažmana, broja angažiranih korisnika i distribucije:

$$S = (E_d / E_w) * D_r * D_s * M$$

Gdje :

- $A$ = _Activity_ - total number of actions accumulated by users within the Deed over the week. (At each Deed’s level, each action is converted into engagement points, some actions weighting more than others. At the index level, all actions are linearized).
- $U$ = _Engaged users_ - korisnici koji su pridonijeli bodovima tijekom tjedna, barem jednom radnjom.
- $E_d$ = _Engagement rate of the deed_ - akcije po korisniku ($A/U$)
- $E_w$ = _Average engagement rate_ svih aktivnih Deeds u WoM-u.
- $D_r$ = _Distribution rate_ - if a Deed received minted Meeds for the preceding period, the % of the Meeds that was distributed to its users. The % can be above 100 if the distribution is delayed in time.
- $D_s$ = _Distribution spread_ - ako je Deed primio iskovane Meedove za prethodno razdoblje, % korisnika koji su primili Meedove u ukupnom skupu korisnika.
- $M$ = _Minting Power_ Deed-a kako je definirano u 2.3


Globalni indeks angažmana koji se koristi za raspodjelu iskovanih Meeds-ova među Deeds-ovima zbroj je svih rezultata angažmana Deeds-a za tjedan.


Gornja formula je jednostavna i osmišljena da favorizira Deeds:

- s puno angažiranih korisnika (angažman)
- koji cijeli prihod od kovanja (stopa raspodjele) pravedno dijele sa svojim korisnicima (raspodjela).

Dodatni pojačivači su postavljeni za:

- organizacije s najvećim angažmanom, bez obzira na njihovu veličinu (stopa angažmana u odnosu na WoM)
- scarrer deeds

> The Meeds association reserves the right to change the formula if required – if some specific use cases arise for instance. The association can also blacklist any Deed that hijacks the formula to its unique benefit.

As the Deeds are rewarded with Meeds and incentivized to redistribute them as rewards to their users against their engagement – the interest of both the Deeds and their users are aligned in the same virtuous revenue sharing cycle. Thus, the WoM offers a new work model, that re-shapes the employer/employee relationship as a partnership.

Model "mintium" prvi je takve vrste - ide dalje od tradicionalnog freemium modela, jer ne samo da su usluge besplatne za korištenje, već su i organizacije i njihovi korisnici nagrađeni za njihovu upotrebu.

## 2.7. Cities and governance

In the WoM, Deeds will be generated gradually inside virtual cities. Only the first city will exist from the start. The others will be built gradually, one after the other. In the entire WoM, there will ever only be 7 cities, each including a fixed number of Deeds of each type.

A city will be considered complete, once all of its Deeds have been minted. Then, the minting of each new city will start $2^n$ months after the last Deed of the $n-1$ city was minted.

| **Ime grada** | **Deeds**   | **Dostupno**          | **Uobičajen** | **Neuobičajeno** | **Rijetko** | **Legendarno** |
| ------------- | ----------- | --------------------- | ------------- | ---------------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| 1: Tanit      | 100         | T0                    | 50            | 30               | 13          | 7              |
| 2: Reshef     | 1 000       | Tanit + 4 mjeseca     | 600           | 300              | 94          | 6              |
| 3: Ashtarte   | 10 000      | Reshef + 8 mjeseca    | 6 000         | 3 000            | 995         | 5              |
| 4: Melqart    | 100 000     | Ashtarte + 16 mjeseca | 60 000        | 30 000           | 9 996       | 4              |
| 5: Eshmun     | 1 000 000   | Melqart + 32 months   | 600 000       | 300 000          | 99 997      | 3              |
| 6: Kushor     | 10 000 000  | Eshmum + 64 months    | 6 000 000     | 3 000 000        | 999 998     | 2              |
| 7: Hammon     | 100 000 000 | Kushor + 128 months   | 60 000 000    | 30 000 000       | 9 999 999   | 1              |

A city is a way for the Deeds to come together and create a community. And as a consequence, acquire a certain identity, associated with that community. It is also a way to provide additional value to its users - value that would go beyond one Deed’s capabilities or value created through cooperation between the Deeds.

Each city has its own govenance and operates its own DAO where the city’s Deeds’ owners can elect their city council, vote and establish their own operating rules, add new services and shape their city in the way that they want and so as to increase the city’s attractiveness and the value of the Deeds attached to it.

For example, they could add a digital representation of their city, physical counterparts associated with their city (meeting rooms in physical co-working spaces for instance), add Meeds powered food services, vacations services, etc...

By default (unless the city votes otherwise), passive income from renting out Deeds will be “taxed” by the city (5%) and the Association (3%) to encourage productive use.

Ownsership transactions (Deed’s sales) will also be taxed 6% :

- 2.5% for the City,
- 2.5% for the Association,
- 1% for the original wallet that redeemed the Deed.
