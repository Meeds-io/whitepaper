# 2. Deeds NFT - 工作 Metaverse 组织

## 2.1. NFT – 契约定义

不可替代代币 (NFT) 是代表商品的独特代币。 在 WoM 中，契约被用作所有权的名称。 每份契约都赋予其所有者访问多项服务的权利——例如，访问由 Meeds 软件提供支持的数字办公室以及铸造 Meeds 的权利。

WoM 欢迎各种组织——DAO、传统公司、协会、智库、合作伙伴、剧院公司、项目组、学校等。 契据代表他们在 WoM 中的数字存在。

## 2.2. Deeds supply 契约供应

WoM 最终将提供有限数量的契据。 每个契约都包含一个预定义的最大用户数，并提供 Meeds 奖励能力（铸币能力）。 此处和下文中的“用户”一词指代任何类型的雇员、工人、自由职业者、志愿者等。

契约有四种类型，每种契约在用户数量、城市投票权（见 2.7）或 Meeds 铸币权方面提供不同的能力，最稀有的是最强大的：

| **契约类型** | **最大用户数** | **Minting power** | **缺乏**  | **城市投票权** |
| -------- | --------- | ----------------- | ------- | --------- |
| 常见的      | 100       | 1                 | ~ 90%   | 1         |
| 罕见       | 1000      | 1.1               | ~ 9%    | 10        |
| 稀有的      | 10 000    | 1.3               | ~ 1%    | 100       |
| 传奇的      | 无限        | 2                 | < 0.1 % | 1000      |

## 2.3. Deeds ownership 契据所有权

契约赋予其所有者使用、出租或出售它的权利。

- 使用——契约的所有者可以直接为他们的组织使用契约，为其用户提供服务。
- 租金 - 契约的所有者也可以将契约出租给另一个组织以获得被动收入。
- 卖 - 契约可以在二级市场上出售，例如 [OpenSea](https://opensea.io)。

作为契约的积极持有人或承租人，该组织通过下文描述的创新“mintium”模型（第 2.6 部分）获得 Meeds 奖励。

## 2.4. 2.4. Deeds services, engagement/rewards engine

In an increasingly competitive market, in order to attract and retain talents and maximize their input, organizations need to incentivize their users beyond simple compensation. The WoM provides an innovative framework to do that by tokenizing work engagement. The WoM provides an innovative framework to do that by tokenizing work engagement.

Each Deed’s holder or renter can provide tools and services to its users, who earn engagement points that can be fine-tuned to the Deed’s priorities. Periodically, points are converted into Meeds (and - for DAOs - potentially another token), based on the Deed’s set budget. In that manner, users’ engagement in activities that matter to the organization is rewarded. Periodically, points are converted into Meeds (and - for DAOs - potentially another token), based on the Deed’s set budget. In that manner, users’ engagement in activities that matter to the organization is rewarded.

To begin with, the following free services provided by the Meeds association can be used to reward engagement:

- **Gamification engine** – automatic actions within the WoM have a weight in points, that can be fine-tuned to the Deed’s priorities via customizable engagement programs.
- **Challenges** – customizable challenges can be set up to represent achievements. Challenges are preset by one person and can be full-filled and announced as such by another. Challenges carry a weight in points, within customizable engagement programs. Challenges are preset by one person and can be full-filled and announced as such by another. Challenges carry a weight in points, within customizable engagement programs.
- **Customizable engagement programs** - organizations can create their own engagement programs matching their business goals and priorities. Programs are associated to automatic actions within the system and manually set challenges. Each program has a set Meeds budget. Periodically points earned by each user through automatics or announced actions in each engagement program are converted into Meeds, based on that program’s budget. Programs are associated to automatic actions within the system and manually set challenges. Each program has a set Meeds budget. Periodically points earned by each user through automatics or announced actions in each engagement program are converted into Meeds, based on that program’s budget.
- **Kudos** - kudos can be awarded by users to each other, as a thank you and a token of recognition. As kudos available to distribute are limited (a preset periodic limit, 3 per week for instance), they are rare and valuable. Like actions, kudos carry points. This way employees are empowered to reward their colleagues. As kudos available to distribute are limited (a preset periodic limit, 3 per week for instance), they are rare and valuable. Like actions, kudos carry points. This way employees are empowered to reward their colleagues.
- **Collaboration** tools, plugged into the rewarding engine – workspaces, asynchronous communication, a task management tool and notes – enable people to work together on projects.
- **Wallet** – users are provided with a secure Ethereum technology wallet to store their Meeds. Alternatively, for advanced users, a Metamask wallet can be used. Alternatively, for advanced users, a Metamask wallet can be used.
- **Store** – a store where Meeds can be exchanged against perks provided by the Deed’s holder or renter or by the Meeds ecosystem.
- **Analytics** – to analyze and follow engagement within the Deed.
- **Connectors**, plugged into the reward engine – users get engagement points via actions in another software - for instance for committing code in GitHub.

Some of the afore-mentioned tools and services are already decentralized, others are not. Some of the afore-mentioned tools and services are already decentralized, others are not. The ultimate goal is to provide all services in a decentralized manner, which we will do gradually as the underlying technology evolves.

New services can be plugged into the reward engine through APIs. Examples are countless and can include virtually any software or service: Examples are countless and can include virtually any software or service:

- CRM software – salespeople would get engagement points for working on opportunities.
- Accounting software – accountants would get engagement points for keeping books.
- Clocking terminal – factory worker can get points for factory work time.
- Etc.

Furthermore, engagement produced via the connector participates in the organization’s global engagement score which is a factor of the Meeds minting distribution, described below. In order to do that, the connector needs to be whitelisted by the Meeds Association. The association reviews the connector, approves of its algorithm and acquires its ownership against Meeds. It then becomes part of the free services provided by the association and is included in the global engagement index. Any other Deed can use the same connector and the same reward algorithm for its developers.

The Deed’s holder or renter can enrich its store with its own perks, connect to an online perks offer etc. There again the possibilities are endless: There again the possibilities are endless:

- Training courses
- Gym memberships
- Vacation packages
- Lunch with a leader in the organization
- Physical office space
- Etc.

The store functions through the use of Meeds so that Meeds are partially returned to the Deed.

## 2.5. 2.5. Rewards – Meeds and other tokens

The WoM will tokenize users engagement, by gamifying digital work tools, and attributing points and Meeds in relation to work engagement. Services plugged into the engagement and reward engine attribute points to each user, according to their engagement level and in line with each Deed’s engagement programs. Indeed, each Deed can fine-tune the amount of points given for each type of activity. The WoM will tokenize users engagement, by gamifying digital work tools, and attributing points and Meeds in relation to work engagement. Services plugged into the engagement and reward engine attribute points to each user, according to their engagement level and in line with each Deed’s engagement programs. Indeed, each Deed can fine-tune the amount of points given for each type of activity. Thus, pushing some code in GitHub may be worth 10 points for an IT shop, while a digital agency may attribute only 5 points for GitHub pushes but would offer 10 points for retweets.

Periodically, the rewarding engine converts engagement points into Meeds according to budgets and other distribution rules and ultimately rewards the users via their wallets. The Deed is not required to distribute Meeds and can use the engagement system to enable some other form of compensation program. However, distributing Meeds will improve its minting capacity. The Deed is not required to distribute Meeds and can use the engagement system to enable some other form of compensation program. However, distributing Meeds will improve its minting capacity.

Moreover, the Deed does not necessarily need to acquire Meeds in order to distribute them and fuel its engagement programs, as it will get Meeds from the “mintium” model, described below.

In addition to Meeds, it will also be possible to distribute other tokens (for instance the DAO’s own tokens) based on the same engagement mechanism. In that case, the distribution will be subject to a 5% transaction fee (in DAO token) for the Meeds Association. In that case, the distribution will be subject to a 5% transaction fee (in DAO token) for the Meeds Association.

## 2.6. 2.6. The “mintium” model – tokenize work engagement

By engaging their users in the WoM, Deeds get compensated through an innovative mintium model.

Engagement points, gained by the Deeds’ users, participate in the global engagement index, calculated by the Meeds Association. The index uses the same principle for all Deeds. Engagement points, gained by the Deeds’ users, participate in the global engagement index, calculated by the Meeds Association. The index uses the same principle for all Deeds. Even though the Deed can change the points’ allocation to promote one action over another, those changes will not be taken into the account in the global index computation.

Each week, a certain amount of Meeds is allocated to the global engagement minting of the WoM. It’s computed weekly, pro-rata, among the participating Deeds. Some Deeds get an additional boost depending on their type. The Deeds that claim their Meeds over the week, receive them. The unclaimed Meeds are added to the following week’s global distribution amount.

The engagement score _S_  of a Deed is a function of the engagement, the number of engaged users and the distribution :

$$S = (E_d / E_w) * D_r * D_s * M$$

Where :

- $A$ = _Activity_ - total number of actions accumulated by users within the Deed over the week. (At each Deed’s level, each action is converted into engagement points, some actions weighting more than others. At the index level, all actions are linearized). (At each Deed’s level, each action is converted into engagement points, some actions weighting more than others. At the index level, all actions are linearized).
- $U$ = _Engaged users_ - users that contributed to points during the week, by at least one action.
- $E_d$ = _Engagement rate of the deed_ - actions per user ($A/U$)
- $E_w$ = _Average engagement rate_ of all active Deeds in the WoM.
- $D_r$ = _Distribution rate_ - if a Deed received minted Meeds for the preceding period, the % of the Meeds that was distributed to its users. The % can be above 100 if the distribution is delayed in time. The % can be above 100 if the distribution is delayed in time.
- $D_s$ =  _Distribution spread_ - if a Deed received minted Meeds for the preceding period, the % of the users that received Meeds in the total pool of users.
- $M$ = _Minting Power_ of the Deed as defined in 2.3


The global engagement index used to distribute minted Meeds among the Deeds is the sum of all Deeds’ engagement scores for the week.


The formula above is simple and designed to favor deeds :

- with lots of engaged users (engagement)
- who share the whole of the minting income (distribution rate) with their users fairly (distribution spread).

Additionnally boosters are in place for :

- organizations with the highest engagement, regardless of their size (engagement rate in relation to the WoM)
- scarcer deeds

> The Meeds association reserves the right to change the formula if required – if some specific use cases arise for instance. The association can also blacklist any Deed that hijacks the formula to its unique benefit. The association can also blacklist any Deed that hijacks the formula to its unique benefit.

As the Deeds are rewarded with Meeds and incentivized to redistribute them as rewards to their users against their engagement – the interest of both the Deeds and their users are aligned in the same virtuous revenue sharing cycle. Thus, the WoM offers a new work model, that re-shapes the employer/employee relationship as a partnership. Thus, the WoM offers a new work model, that re-shapes the employer/employee relationship as a partnership.

The “mintium” model is the first of a kind - it goes further than the traditional freemium one, as not only the services are free to use but both the organizations and their users are rewarded for using them.

## 2.7. 2.7. Cities and governance

In the WoM, Deeds will be generated gradually inside virtual cities. Only the first city will exist from the start. The others will be built gradually, one after the other. In the entire WoM, there will ever only be 7 cities, each including a fixed number of Deeds of each type. Only the first city will exist from the start. The others will be built gradually, one after the other. In the entire WoM, there will ever only be 7 cities, each including a fixed number of Deeds of each type.

A city will be considered complete, once all of its Deeds have been minted. A city will be considered complete, once all of its Deeds have been minted. Then, the minting of each new city will start $2^n$ months after the last Deed of the $n-1$ city was minted.

| **City name** | **Deeds**   | **Available**        | **常见的**    | **罕见**     | **稀有的**   | **传奇的** |
| ------------- | ----------- | -------------------- | ---------- | ---------- | --------- | ------- |
| 1: Tanit      | 100         | T0                   | 50         | 30         | 13        | 7       |

| 3: Ashtarte   | 10 000      | Reshef + 8 months    | 6 000      | 3 000      | 995       | 5       |

A city is a way for the Deeds to come together and create a community. And as a consequence, acquire a certain identity, associated with that community. It is also a way to provide additional value to its users - value that would go beyond one Deed’s capabilities or value created through cooperation between the Deeds. And as a consequence, acquire a certain identity, associated with that community. It is also a way to provide additional value to its users - value that would go beyond one Deed’s capabilities or value created through cooperation between the Deeds.

Each city has its own govenance and operates its own DAO where the city’s Deeds’ owners can elect their city council, vote and establish their own operating rules, add new services and shape their city in the way that they want and so as to increase the city’s attractiveness and the value of the Deeds attached to it.

For example, they could add a digital representation of their city, physical counterparts associated with their city (meeting rooms in physical co-working spaces for instance), add Meeds powered food services, vacations services, etc...

By default (unless the city votes otherwise), passive income from renting out Deeds will be “taxed” by the city (5%) and the Association (3%) to encourage productive use.

Ownsership transactions (Deed’s sales) will also be taxed 6% :

- 2.5% for the City,
- 2.5% for the Association,
- 1% for the original wallet that redeemed the Deed.
