# 4. 4. 4. Xeeds - Work Metaverse Individuals / users

## 4.1. 4.1. 4.1. Decentralized and self-sovereign models

The WoM recognizes privacy as a fundamental human right and empowers users to own their data.

Our approach is based on decentralized and self-sovereign identity principles, allowing users to be in control at any time of what information they want to publicize, share with a restricted group, or keep private.

User's activity and engagement in the WoM is always linked to a Deed. A Xeed is the virtual persona of a user in a Deed. Xeed does not require any KYC, it is self-declaring, but we could conceivably imagine third-party firms providing this service.

## 4.2. 4.2. 4.2. Badges and credentials

Badges and Credentials are given to users as a part of their participation in a Deed. The holder may download them as W3C Verifiable Credentials[^7][^8] (aka VCs) and store them in his wallet. Those VCs are proof of knowledge/know-how certified by the organization issuing it.

In today’s world, it is hard to prove a skill beforehand. When people advertise themselves on networks, they count on their managers to give them a recommendation. The latter supposes certain goodwill on the part of the manager but is not necessarily treated as proof by the future employer.

The Work Metaverse provides a more transparent and immutable means for people to acquire and demonstrate their abilities.

Badges are used to represent accomplishments made within a Deed. After completing a set of objectives or challenges, users will be awarded points. Badges can be unlocked by accumulating certain amounts of points in specific categories.

When badges are downloaded by the user, it is possible to include the number of points and his rank in the Deed for this specific accomplishment.

Credentials are more flexible than Badges; they could be a recommendation from a peer, indicating years of expertise, a training or exam completion, or engagement in the Deed. These are signed by the Deed and can be accompanied by a signature by a peer user. These are signed by the Deed and can be accompanied by a signature by a peer user. These are signed by the Deed and can be accompanied by a signature by a peer user.

## 4.3. 4.3. 4.3. Digital work identity

All of the above contributes to forming proven digital skillset that can be kept and used by the user when changing jobs or freelancing. It would be more trustworthy than traditional solutions as it relies on not just one individual but a full community to prove it.

Just like his Meeds wallet, the user will retain his Xeed, Badges, and Credentials attached to it in his identity wallet when moving from one Deed to another, from one city to another, anywhere through the WoM.

The user will be able to share his Xeed, Badges, and Credentials with other Deeds to highlight his experience, as well as with recruiters or any other services that he deems interesting.

A user can have one or several digital identities in the WoM. He could later present them in a unified way using verified presentations.

Contrary to web 2, the user is in full ownership of his decentralized identities. The latter can show (and prove) the Deeds he participated in, his proven skills, his claimed skills, other Xeeds (people) whom he worked with, his digital representation of himself... In a manner of trustworthy LinkedIn 3.0.

The user will be able to select whether or not to reveal anything, what information to provide, and which identities to use for each position. The content (proven skill, previous Deeds, etc.) is tamper proof and so could not be modified. Any identity would have to be developed over time.

## 4.4. Fair work marketplace

Within this paradigm the future work marketplace allows users to move freely and allocate/sell their engagement among the Deeds – as they do in the physical world by changing employers. However, in the WoM their engagement would be tangible, measured and rewarded in a fair way. By moving between systems that follow a similar logic, they will better understand the rules of the game and will judge employers fairly – grass is not always greener elsewhere. Users will be able to choose which Deed provides better engagement reward conditions, belongs to a more attractive city, etc.

On their end, the Deeds’ holders/renters can search for relevant skills using the WoM network of digital work identities (that the users decided to disclose). They will be able to source skills more effectively, based on verified and detailed information on work history, work skills and engagement level of the user. They will be able to source skills more effectively, based on verified and detailed information on work history, work skills and engagement level of the user. They will be able to source skills more effectively, based on verified and detailed information on work history, work skills and engagement level of the user.

## 4.5. 4.5. 4.5. Tangible and transparent recognition

Today, details on compensation and bonuses are obscure in many workplaces. Therefore, it is difficult for a person to compare his conditions to that of another and get a sense of a fair and unbiased treatment. Employees experience a lot of frustrations with the above.

The WoM introduces an objective way to recognize achievements and reward them.

Engagement recognition and reward mechanism is transparent and applies fairly to all users, following the same explicit rules, decided in advance and aligned with the Deed’s goals.

Wallets are individual and blockchain based – when the user receives a reward or earns a badge, it cannot be taken back or erased.

## 4.6. 4.6. 4.6. Access to Web 3.0, cryptoeconomy and DEFI services

As discussed above, the Work Metaverse opens the world of cryptocurrency and decentralized web services to basically everyone – a very large population of users, even possibly unrelated to the digital field.

Indeed, any work engagement can potentially be tokenized. In fact the world is becoming increasingly digital with trends such as 5G, iot, wearables and so forth. As a consequence, potentially more and more signals could be captured and analysed to tokenize the engagement of non-digital professions. Challenges provide a ready to go way to tokenize it by representing achievements in the physical world.

Any user can get Meeds and use a Meeds wallet to get access to new age services without any special training.
