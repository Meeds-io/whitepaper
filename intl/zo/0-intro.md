## Abstract

Today’s work market lacks efficiency because of high transaction costs[^1][^2][^3] and frequent conflicts of interests between the employer and the employee.

The Work Metaverse (the WoM) proposes a new paradigm that would lower transaction costs and reinvent the employment relationship, bridging the gap between traditional corporations and DAOs.

The WoM does that by introducing digital identities for both employer and employee and offering an innovative engagement reward system that would align their interests.

## Introduction

The work market today is broken. It fails to satisfy both employees and employers. It fails to satisfy both employees and employers. It fails to satisfy both employees and employers.

On the employee side, it is difficult to find the right jobs. The job market favors certain types of individuals, leaving great skill sets behind. This comes from a set of human biases – racial based, gender based, handicap based, introvert based etc. The work market also lacks transparency as to the available positions and employment conditions.

Once employed, employee’s personal liberties are infringed upon in exchange for compensation. Employees have little say in their work hours, workplace, work content or work methods. And their compensation is rarely linked to their real implication or value. Compensation rules lack transparency and, hence, are perceived as unfair. Moreover, compensation and career progress are also dependent on the human factor – the employee immediate manager’s good faith and objectivity.

Employers, on the other hand, experience difficulties at sourcing talent and hiring the right skills and the right fit at the right time for the job. Employers, on the other hand, experience difficulties at sourcing talent and hiring the right skills and the right fit at the right time for the job. Employers, on the other hand, experience difficulties at sourcing talent and hiring the right skills and the right fit at the right time for the job. There is no objective way to ascertain the potential hire’s skills or source people outside of the employer’s traditional hiring pool.

Employers also deal with the lack of loyalty from their employees and a high turnover, both of which, increase hiring and on-boarding costs.

Moreover, employers also face low engagement in their existing employees, leading to low creativity, productivity and innovation. The latter inflicts all the more damage in today’s economy requiring more skilled creative work. The latter inflicts all the more damage in today’s economy requiring more skilled creative work. The latter inflicts all the more damage in today’s economy requiring more skilled creative work.

All of the above boil down to high transaction costs and the exacerbated agent-principal problem[^4] :

- With Internet, job markets did evolve towards more unity and transparency thanks to job posting sites, career sites, etc. But transactions costs are still too high in the absence of objectivity element. But transactions costs are still too high in the absence of objectivity element. But transactions costs are still too high in the absence of objectivity element.
- As to the agent-principal problem, it has been compounded by the increasing revenue and wealth gap between employees and shareholders and the rigidity of the employer-employee relationship.

The WoM aims at solving both through a new decentralized work paradigm.

Following R. Coase’s works[^5], most economists link the concept of enterprise with the necessity to mitigate transaction costs. Internet and more recently blockchain and web3 open exciting possibilities in lowering transaction costs everywhere, reinventing economy and in particular reinventing the enterprise. The first DAOs[^6] started this process focusing on lowering the cost of transactions for capital sourcing and governance. The WoM aims at pushing this logic further by lowering the cost of work transactions. It proposes a decentralized world where jobs and skills matching could be done objectively, quickly and globally.

The first DAOs flatten the hierarchies and open ownership. The WoM pursues this logic by reinventing rather than suppressing the employer/employee relationship. It introduces a transparent, objective and decentralized reward paradigm, that would sustainably align the employer and the employee interests.

Finally, the Work Metaverse bridges the gap between corporations and the DAOs. On one hand, it introduces traditional corporations into the decentralized world through an easy to apply engagement rewarding paradigm, complementing their compensation systems. On the other hand, it proposes sustainable ways to operate and create value for DAOs. Ultimately, the WoM could be among the first mainstream applications to democratize the use of the blockchain for every company and every employee – including non-digital ones.

As with any decentralized venture, the WoM proposal gains in value exponentially as more people use it. For that reason, founders took great care to encourage long term interest and avoid monopolizing the WoM benefits, whether short term or long term. It is an open paradigm, still to be built, and open to active creative participation from everyone.
