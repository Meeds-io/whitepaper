# 1. 1. 1. Who we are – the Meeds Association

The Meeds association is a non-profit organization originally launched by several Open Source Software (OSS) communities around the common vision of a free digital world – a decentralized world that would not be controlled by a handful of centralized mega-corporations.

The Meeds association is incorporated in Geneva, as a non-profit association under the Swiss law.

The association regulates the issuance of the Meeds currency, an ERC20 token, recognized as a utility token.

To build the WoM and Meeds, the association leverages the Ethereum platform and its ecosystem, making it accessible in a friendly and cost-effective way to all users.

The association is structured as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) where the governance token holders vote on all important organizational changes such as electing the board every year.

Besides Meeds token management, the association holds the Intellectual Property (IP) of the Meeds software [github.com/meeds-io](https://github.com/meeds-io), available under the LGPL license and distributed for free. The latter includes an Ethereum wallet app that users can use to store and transact their Meeds (see section 2.4 for more details). The Meeds Association also runs a multi-tenant cloud hosting service leveraging that software.
