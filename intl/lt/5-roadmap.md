# 5. The Work Metaverse for ALL – vision summary and milestones

## 5.1. Ultimate goal - decentralized web for everyone

Galiausiai WoM tai decentralizuotas žiniatinklio pasaulis kiekvienam - kiekvienam asmeniui ir kiekvienai organizacijai.

It will be populated by users, acting through their digital identities **Xeeds** and accessing the world through their metamasks, for crypto-savvies, or login/password for the newbies. People would allocate their engagement and get rewarded in a fair, transparent and decentralized way. They would get access to the decentralized world and the cryptoworld of tomorrow in an easy and familiar way - they would get simple tools to use their tokens in their lives or invest them for their future.

Organizations - **Deeds** would be able to source talents, browsing through the WoM, for the right proven skills. They would get rewarded for their participation in the metaverse, by minting tokens through their users engagement (mintium model). But most of all, they would benefit from a higher engagement and loyalty from their users.

The WoM would have its own currency **Meeds** – that would be there to spend in stores, convert into another currency, invest for a return on investment, rent or buy etc. The WoM would also facilitate other tokens distribution and participate in the overall crypto ecosystem.

Kadangi paveikslėlis vertas tūkstančio žodžių, pateikiame schemą, kurioje aprašyti WoM ir Meedso srautai

Pasaulio išlaikymas ir tvarumas ilgalaikėje perspektyvoje užtikrinamas mokesčiais, kuriais dalijasi Meeds asociacija ir Miestai.

## 5.2. What’s in it for early adopters

Akivaizdu, kad ankstyvieji diegėjai gaus daug pranašumų prieš vėlyvuosius.

In particular, the WoM rewards long-term investment in the verse – that is the redeeming of the property (Deeds). The Deed’s original owner get compensated through engagement minting (active use), through passive income (renting) and get a life-long 1% on any selling transaction of the Deed (at each change of ownership, the original redeemer gets a fee on the transaction).

By believing in the project, participating in the liquidity pools, staking Meeds, redeeming them against Deeds...early investors of all sizes would mint additional tokens. They would also get the earliest voting rights and help shape the metaverse.

Organizations acquiring but especially using Deeds to engage and reward their employees would get compensated in minted Meeds. The fairer they will play, the more they will get. The earlier adopters would be associated to the first historic cities and would be identified as the builders later on.

Organizacijos, žinoma, gali dalyvauti likvidumo fonduose, bet taip pat prisijungti prie statytojų bendruomenės ir ten gauti papildomą atlygį už įsitraukimą.

## 5.3. The launch

The official launch date is set as for **May 1st, 2022** – the International Workers Day, celebrated in many countries.

At that time, the Meed token already exists. It is possible to acquire it and liquidity pools are open for participation, on Polygon and Ethereum networks.

Three Meeds association members use the system internally to engage and reward their users and improve the Meeds software.

The Investor app is available on Ethereum Mainnet. At launch, it includes staking, liquidity rewards, points accumulation and redeeming of Deeds.

The Builders community is up and running on Meeds software, open to anyone who would want to join, test and participate. It is possible to login with Metamask.

This paper was published on the launch day. Following the launch, the token will be air-dropped to many people across the crypto community.

## 5.4. The builders community

We are launching the builders community on the Meeds software and on Discord. The community welcomes anyone who wants to take part in the building of the Work Metaverse. The association would reward builders engagement with Meeds, from its marketing budget.

The association plans also to stake some Meeds in order to acquire (redeem) a Deed for the builders community. The community will then mint Meeds by engagement, through the mintium model, and distribute them to engaged users.

## 5.5. Roadmap and milestones

Mūsų veiksmų planas būtų sudarytas toliau nurodyta prioritetine tvarka:

- Įsitraukimo indeksas ir monetų kalimas per įsitraukimą
- Įgalinti Deeds nuomą
- Xeed kūrimas
- Ženkliukų tobulinimas ir įgaliojimų kūrimas
- DeFi paslaugos - piniginėje, partnerystė su kredito kortelėmis

We are counting on the early adopters from the DAOs and tech-savvy companies during the building stage. We should also have some early adopters from traditional companies that gain immediate value from the metaverse byproviding relevant engagement programs to their people, on top of their current traditional compensation plans.

Meeds minting spans a 20 year period. By that time, we aspire to have achieved building a mature metaverse, having spread to many organizations and many users globally.
